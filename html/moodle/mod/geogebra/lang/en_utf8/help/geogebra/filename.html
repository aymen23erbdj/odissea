<b>IMPORTANT</b>: A variable named <b>grade</b> must be defined in each GeoGebra activity to allow Moodle save properly the score, which will be updated depending on the user actions. If it doesn't exist, the grade will be always 0. Therefore, if the grade isn't defined, it's recommended to select <b>No grading</b> option as <b>Grading Method</b>.
