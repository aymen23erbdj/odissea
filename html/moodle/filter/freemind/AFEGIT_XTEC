Moodle installation

For Moodle to display mind maps created by the FreeMind desktop application, you (or your administrator) must install certain server-side components in Moodle. There are two components which are separately installed:

   1. the freemind-browser package, which you will get from sourceforge
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/freemind/files/
      0.9.0 RC 8
   2. the freemind-filter package, which you will get from the Moodle Modules and Plugins database
